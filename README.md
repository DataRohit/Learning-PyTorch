# PyTorch Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I created while learning PyTorch. I used the following resource to learn PyTorch:

- [Learn PyTorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)

The notebooks cover various topics and tasks related to PyTorch, including linear regression, multi-class classification, CNN, transfer learning, and more.
